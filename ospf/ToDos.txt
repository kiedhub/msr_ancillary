# IPv6

ipv6 ip addresses assigned to docker bridges are not the ones configured in compose.yaml (compose_sample.yaml).

daemon.json only assings a prefix to the default docker bridge and doesn't seem to help.

There is a workaround described here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39649458/how-to-assign-ipv6-address-with-docker-compose
Worth a try
- create a network
docker network create --subnet=172.16.2.0/24 --gateway=172.16.2.1 --ipv6 --subnet=<myV6Network/subnet> dockerbridge

- reference the netowrk name in the compose.yaml file
networks:
  dockerbridge:
    external:
      name: dockerbridge
